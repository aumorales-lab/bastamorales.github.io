        <h2>About Me <i class="ph-bold ph-user"></i></h2>
        <h3>Computer Science Student</h3>

        <p>
          I'm Aubrey, a first-year Computer Science student who enjoys understanding how
          systems work—how data moves, how programs communicate, and how a simple idea
          can be turned into something real through code. I’ve always been curious about
          why things work the way they do, and Computer Science became the space where I
          get to explore that curiosity while building something meaningful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love creating small but thoughtful projects, whether it’s experimenting with
          backend logic, trying new concepts, or figuring out how to make a program more
          efficient. Even if I'm still learning, every new thing I discover makes me want
          to improve, try again, and challenge myself. My goal is to build systems and
          tools that feel clean, simple, and actually helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I spend a lot of my time reading manhwas. I love getting
          wrapped up in different stories—romance, fantasy, action, anything that
          pulls me into another world for a while. Reading helps me relax and also inspires
          me creatively, especially in the way characters and plots are built. It’s one of
          the things that keeps me balanced whenever school or programming gets stressful.
          I also enjoy music, design, and anything that lets me express myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m still growing, still learning, and still figuring things out—but I’m excited
          for everything that comes next. Every project, every mistake, and every new idea
          helps me become a little better than yesterday.
